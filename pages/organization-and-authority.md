**Why TBT is an Association Health Plan (AHP)**

“... there is an explicit safe harbor under which a substantial business purpose is considered to exist in cases where the group or association would be a viable entity even in the absence of sponsoring an employee benefit plan. TBT has been and continues to be the medical services business since 1994 without regard to health insurance benefit plans. Association rules state that business purposes are not required to be a for-profit purpose. Thus, for example, a bona fide group or association could offer other services to its members, such as convening conferences or offering classes or educational materials on business issues of interest to the association members and TBT has done and does those services. Depending on facts and circumstances, a bona fide group or association might be tax-exempt under Code section 501(a) as an organization described in Code section 501(c), with a purpose unrelated to the sponsorship of the AHP, if it meets all the requirements for exempt status, including furthering an exempt purpose. TBT has met that requirement since it was formed and was granted tax exempt status as a501a under code section 501(c) in 1996. A bona fide group or association could also act as a standard-setting organization that establishes business standards or practices. TBT does that in health care.”

**Commonality of Interest within the TBT AHP**

Member employers, large or small, are either medical care providers or companies or individuals that are volunteers as defined in the by-laws of TBT. Volunteers in TBT are self-employed members (2 or more people) to provide the labor and resources needed to achieve health education and care that is supportive of the direct care given by the professional providers.
