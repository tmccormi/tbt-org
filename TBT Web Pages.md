**Introduction to TBT**

*Tomorrow’s Bread Today is committed to*:

1\. 	Love, Peace, Truth, Tolerance, and Cooperation,

2\. 	Working and ministering within the local community in the service of others and especially the poor,

3\. 	Performance of Corporal and Spiritual works of mercy within every community where we serve,

4\. 	Commitment to the construction and operation of facilities and organizations necessary to serve the health care and shelter needs of members of local communities.

We are a 501c3 non-profit organization dedicated to doing the works of mercy and to building an economic system through cooperation between individuals and families in local communities.

We concentrate on basic areas of need and service: healthcare, housing, food, transportation, and recreation. We embrace the idea that economics should be small-scale, emanate from cooperative and peaceful people, and should extend to the whole community as if all people and nature matter.

We have been in existence since 1994 and have worked mostly on healthcare for patients and their physicians to make healthcare outcomes better and the cost of care affordable.

Consequently, we have programs in which the cost is 50% less than market rates and without pre-existing exclusions and available to both individuals and groups. We would like to build cooperatives in local communities that express the people’s economics we have discovered. We seek members who can help us grow cooperatives in local communities and who agree with our ideas and purposes.

Complete information about us is on this website. Please do not hesitate to call us if the goals we have stated are of interest to you and your family, friends, and neighbors.

*Why TBT is an Association Health Plan (AHP)*

“… there is an explicit safe harbor under which a substantial business purpose is considered to exist in cases where the group or association would be a viable entity even in the absence of sponsoring an employee benefit plan. TBT has been and continues to be the medical services business since 1994 without regard to health insurance benefit plans. Association rules state that business purposes are not required to be a for-profit purpose. Thus, for example, a bona fide group or association could offer other services to its members, such as convening conferences or offering classes or educational materials on business issues of interest to the association members and TBT has done and does those services. Depending on facts and circumstances, a bona fide group or association might be tax-exempt under Code section 501(a) as an organization described in Code section 501(c), with a purpose unrelated to the sponsorship of the AHP, if it meets all the requirements for exempt status, including furthering an exempt purpose. TBT has met that requirement since it was formed and was granted tax exempt status as a501a under code section 501(c) in 1996\. A bona fide group or association could also act as a standard-setting organization that establishes business standards or practices. TBT does that in health care.”

*Commonality of Interest within the TBT AHP*

Member employers, large or small, are either medical care providers or companies or individuals that are volunteers as defined in the by-laws of TBT. Volunteers in TBT are self-employed members (2 or more people) to provide the labor and resources needed to achieve health education and care that is supportive of the direct care given by the professional providers.
