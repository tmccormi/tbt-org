        <p><strong>Tomorrow’s Bread Today is committed to:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Love, Peace, Truth, Tolerance, and Cooperation,</li>
<li>Working and ministering within the local community in the service of others and especially the poor,</li>
<li>Performance of Corporal and Spiritual works of mercy within every community where we serve,</li>
<li>Commitment to the construction and operation of facilities and organizations necessary to serve the health care and shelter needs of members of local communities.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are a 501c3 non-profit organization dedicated to doing the works of mercy and to building an economic system through cooperation between individuals and families in local communities.</p>
<p>We concentrate on basic areas of need and service: healthcare, housing, food, transportation, and recreation. We embrace the idea that economics should be small-scale, emanate from cooperative and peaceful people, and should extend to the whole community as if all people and nature matter.</p>
<p>We have been in existence since 1994 and have worked mostly on healthcare for patients and their physicians to make healthcare outcomes better and the cost of care affordable.</p>
<p>Consequently, we have programs in which the cost is 50% less than market rates and without pre-existing exclusions and available to both individuals and groups. We would like to build cooperatives in local communities that express the people’s economics we have discovered. We seek members who can help us grow cooperatives in local communities and who agree with our ideas and purposes.</p>
<p>Complete information about us is on this website. Please do not hesitate to email us if the goals we have stated are of interest to you and your family, friends, and neighbors.</p>
